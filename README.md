## üí° Frequently Asked Questions

### üëâ How to Upgrade CasaOS

Run the following command:

    curl -fsSL https://get.casaos.io/update/v0.4.4-alpha | sudo bash


### üëâ Error 404 Not Found during install

This could be caused by your CasaOS running on a port other than the default `port 80`. You need to add the `-u` flag at the end to tell command which port your CasaOS is running:

```bash
casaos-cli app-management register app-store https://casaos-appstore.paodayag.dev/linuxserver.zip -u "localhost:<my-casa-os-port>"
```

Replace `<my-casa-os-port>` with the port where your CasaOS is running. For example if my CasaOS is running on port 99:

```bash
casaos-cli app-management register app-store https://casaos-appstore.paodayag.dev/linuxserver.zip -u "localhost:99"
```

### üëâ How to uninstall the LinuxServer Appstore

Get the assigned ID of the LinuxServer Appstore:

    casaos-cli app-management list app-stores

Unregister the LinuxServer Appstore:

    casaos-cli app-management unregister app-store <linuxserver-appstore-id>

> NOTE: Replace <linuxserver-appstore-id> with the corresponding ID of the LinuxServer Appstore.
